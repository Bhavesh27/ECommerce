## ECommerce Website Using Spring-MVC

A complete E-Commerce websites for selling books and e-books developed using JavaEE Technologies like SpringMVC, SpringCore, Hibernate, JSP.

## Motivation

The main motivation was amazon.com which started as a bookstore and grew out so much more.Also, the project provided me the oppurtunity to dive into building enterprise edition apps using Java Spring Framework and ORM Library Hibernate and learn so much more while developing and building .


## Build status
Build status of continus integration 

	* No-xml Spring MVC web application
	* JSP, Bootstrap
	* JPA (Hibernate/HSQLDB/Spring Data JPA)
	* JUnit/Mockito
	* Spring Security

## Prerequisites

	* JDK 8
	* Maven 3
	* Tomcat Server (Preferably 9) 


## Code style

Project is developed using standard Java Design Pattern in order to enhance code modularity and make it more understandable.
DAO (Data Access Object) desin Pattern is followed.DAO Design Pattern is used to separate the data persistence logic in a separate layer. This way, the service remains completely in dark about how the low-level operations to access the database is done. This is known as the principle of <b>Separation of Logic</b>.
With DAO design pattern, we have following components on which our design depends:

	* The model which is transferred from one layer to the other.
	* The interfaces which provides a flexible design.
	* The interface implementation which is a concrete implementation of the persistence logic.
